DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
Minimalist and simple.

USER INTERACTIONS
Initial page should be very simple and intuitive.  Only a couple options for the user.  [Should I add a description on the site about what it actually does?]



BUGS / FIXES / CHANGES
Check font color in company input forms.
Add descriptions for new company inputs.
Decide how to round the number outputs.
Change unit tests to use mongoose page, not lbofunctions file.
